INFO:
This is the matlab code of the paper 
Shuze geng,Ming Yu, Yingchun Guo" Re-ranking Person Re-Identification with multiple metrics".

STRUCTURE:
-All the main script and function codes are located under root path;
-All parsed datesets are located under "dataset/";
-All additional libs and data parsing codes are located under "Assistant Code/".

HOW TO RUN THE DEMO:
- Data preparation 
    Parsing images to appropriate format by running "load_DATASET.m" in folder "Assistant Code";
    If you want to use your own data set, please refer any load function for the detail of data structure 
    The demo only give a example of viper dataset. If you want to use another datasets, you should extract features.

- To run the example, please start with "run_demo.m";
- Local Binary Pattern (Assistant Code/LBP)
